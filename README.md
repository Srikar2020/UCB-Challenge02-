# UCB-Challenge02-
HW Week 3

https://srikar2020.github.io/UCB-Challenge02-/

Used HTML and CSS to create a portfolio for myself and was able to use alot of what we learned in the second week to implement alot of what we learned. Such as Hover, grids, more advanced CSS. All of which was very difcult at first. I included a couple of images linking back to the webpage. Using what we had from challenge 01 as a refrense only I edited the given starter code to fit my template. Started with HTML and moved to CSS. Then I made sure the styling and positioning of the code was logicaly structured independently. Commbined the CSS to make the code easier to access. The Images elements I also made sure that the alt attributes were easily accessible. When I view the heading attributes I can see the sequential order everything was flowing smoothly. When I view the title element I was able to describie it in the code so that when it is accessed in the inspection area you read it.

The overall challenge was very intriguing and quite difficult at first. I havent been challenged like this in awhile and I cant wait to start on the next one! I was behind from the begining and I had to catchup but I think I was able to compelte this on time and happy with the results.
